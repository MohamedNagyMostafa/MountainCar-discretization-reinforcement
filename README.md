This repository provides a q-learning implementation for Mountain Car problem using `OpenAI Gym`. 

# MountainCar Discretization Reinforcement: AI Course Lab 🤖
This code repository contains the implementation of Q-Learning agent for Mountain Car game. It is part of the lab exercise for the *COSC-604 Artificial Intelligence* course for masters students at Khalifa University.

## 📁 Functions & Classes

`QLearningAgent`: Contains the QLearningAgent class for Q-Learning algorithm.

`run`: To run the training of the agent.

## 🎮 Game
The agent is trained to play Mountain Car game which is a classic reinforcement learning problem where the agent has to learn to drive a car up a hill.

## 🚀 Getting Started
To get started, clone the repository and run the main.py file.

## 🧠 Algorithm
The Q-Learning algorithm is used to train the agent. The algorithm uses a Q-table to store the values of state-action pairs.

## 🎯 Objective
The objective of the agent is to drive the car up the hill and reach the goal position in the minimum number of steps possible.

## 🏋️‍♀️ Training
The agent is trained for 10,000 episodes with a decay in the exploration rate after each episode.

## 👀 Visualization
Visualization of the game can be enabled by setting the visual parameter to True in the run function in the main.py file.

## 🤖 Future Work
The code can be extended to implement other reinforcement learning algorithms such as SARSA and DQN.
